    <p>Hello, I am Henry Maag and I am a Sophomore in college at FGCU. I have been a major in software engineering over the past semester. I enjoy snowboarding and watching hockey in my free time. It is my goal to eventually move to either Minnesota or Colorado after attaining a degree in software engineering.</p>

    <p>I have gotten rid of certain elements that I felt were not necessary in the project. I have also removed the scratch project that I previously had on, as it was not reliably showing up.</p></div>
